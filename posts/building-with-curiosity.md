# Building with Curiosity

Curiosity is my favorite tool. It's what nudges me to open source repositories just to see how they're organized, deconstruct design systems, and tinker with hardware setups that are only half documented. Curiosity turns unfamiliar territory into an invitation.

## Follow the Questions

When I start a new project, I list the questions that feel most interesting—sometimes they're technical, sometimes they're about people. Those questions keep me motivated long after the initial rush of inspiration fades.

## Share the Process

One of my goals with this blog is to make the messy middle visible. I'll share prototypes, half-finished experiments, and retrospectives on what worked (and what didn't). If that encourages someone else to build, it's worth it.

## Keep Moving

Momentum comes from taking the next small step. A commit, a sketch, a paragraph—it's all progress. Here's to chasing the questions together.
