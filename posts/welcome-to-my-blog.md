# Welcome to My Blog

Hello and welcome! I'm Curtis Covington, and this space is where I'll share the ideas, lessons, and experiments that are shaping my journey as a developer and creative. Expect thoughtful breakdowns of the projects I'm working on, notes on the tools that inspire me, and the occasional reflection on the bigger picture. I'm glad you're here—make yourself at home.

## Why I Started This Blog

I've always enjoyed learning in public. Writing about what I'm exploring helps me clarify my thinking, and it creates a trail that others can follow. Whether you're a fellow developer, a curious friend, or someone who stumbled in from the wider web, I hope you find something here that sparks your own curiosity.

## What to Expect

I'll be posting about:

- Web development techniques and best practices
- Design inspiration and user experience insights
- Personal retrospectives on wins, challenges, and lessons learned
- Occasional deep dives into the tools, frameworks, and books that keep me energized
